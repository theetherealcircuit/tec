  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <section>
    <p><strong class="highlight">Born from a decade of raw exploration</strong>, years of walking unknown paths—on
      bikes, on foot, through forests and forgotten towns, countless conversations with village elders, and wisdom from
      travel veterans across the nation, we understood something. We wander for distraction, but we travel for
      fulfillment.</p>

    <p><strong>The Ethereal Circuit</strong> grew from planning and execution, insights from elders, and lessons from
      the land itself. We don’t offer tours; we craft <span class="highlight">immersive learning ecosystems</span>.</p>

    <p>Each circuit invites you to live with local communities, learn lost crafts, join sacred traditions, and
      contribute meaningfully to people and planet.</p>

    <p>We’re dismantling conventional tourism. Where others provide sightseeing, we facilitate <em>understanding</em>.
      Where others offer itineraries, we design <em>immersions</em>. Each traveller becomes a student, protector, and
      friend—leaving destinations richer than they found them.</p>

    <p>This is travel as it should be: <span class="highlight">authentic, responsible, transformative</span>.</p>

  <h2>Where It All Starts</h2>
  <section class="founding-story">
    <p>It began on a dusty road in Uttarakhand, where the air still carried stories and the mountains listened. We
      weren’t looking to start anything. We were just walking—through old ruins, tribal hamlets, forgotten temples, and
      stories etched into rocks and riverbeds.</p>

    <p>What we found wasn’t beauty — <span class="highlight">we found urgency!</span> Villages rich with memory but
      empty of listeners. Kids on educational trips who left without learning. Forests sacred for centuries, now turned
      to littered trails.</p>

    <p>We understood then that travel had become a beautiful lie — that motion equaled growth, distance equaled depth,
      and consumption equaled experience. Something inside us said: <strong>this can’t be it!</strong></p>

    <p>So, we kept walking. From Himalayan valleys to desert shrines, from Northeast jungles to coastal sanctuaries. We
      sat with elders who carried stories no screen could store. We learned to see not just landscapes, but
      <strong>living histories</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>That walk never ended. It became <strong class="highlight">The Ethereal Circuit</strong> — a constellation of
      experiences rooted in preservation, participation, and regeneration.</p>

  <h2>Our Team</h2>
  <section class="team-section">
    <p>The soul of The Ethereal Circuit is its people. Not guides. Not staff. But <strong class="highlight">guardians of
        stories, places, and wisdom</strong>.</p>

    <p>They are nomads who carry the songs of the forest. Historians and archaeologists who bring silence to life.
      Mountaineers who know when to pause. Teachers who turn a trail into a classroom. Storytellers and photographers
      who see what others miss. Climate scientists and environmentalists who remind us how to care.</p>

    <p>At the heart are the local custodians—folk artists, healers, and tradition-keepers—who give every journey its
      spirit. <strong>They’re not behind the scenes. They are the scene.</strong></p>

    <p>This team doesn’t sell travel. They protect a way of moving through the world—with respect, with care, with
      meaning. With them, you’re not a tourist. <span class="highlight">You’re part of something worth living
        for.</span></p>
